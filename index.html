<p>I spend my evenings watching SICP videos, reading The Dragon Book and revisiting favourite chapters of CLRS. Two years ago I would spend my friday evening on a TopCoder round.</p>

<p>My current gig is a YC company of 13 people. The one before was 4 guys hacker house with pool!</p>

<p>I write my code in JavaScript, know how to use MongoDB, have no experience with SQL but if I choose one it would be Postgresql!</p>

<p>All my webapps are written in Meteor, I might even use CoffeeScript and will definitely choose ElasticSearch as a full-text search solution. What else can I through into those apps? Redis, RethinkDB, Doozer and PhoneGap? Sounds good.</p>

<p>What is my favorite language? The answer should be "Lisp" but I am going with Clojure this time.</p>

<p>Vim only, Emacs free. I even own books on Vim and I spent hours in the Internet arguing it is the editor <em>real programmers</em> use!</p>

<p>MBP, Thunderbolt display, Kinesis Advantage keyboard and a convertible standing desk - this is the standard in my company!</p>

<p>I enjoy learning the advanced layers of Computer Science. After spending several years on Competitive Programming I finally arrived to the industry.</p>

<p>Right now I am actively learning about:</p>

<ul>
<li>SICP</li>
<li>Compilers (coursera course)</li>
<li>Distributed Systems (something I learn from my peers)</li>
</ul><p>Today I work at <a href="https://www.meteor.com">Meteor</a>. Before I worked at <a href="https://collections.me">Collections</a>.</p>

<p>I try to hack on different ideas on the weekends. Most of them never get implemented because of my laziness but some make it to my Github profile, mostly algorithmy things.</p>
