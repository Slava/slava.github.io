Core Developer. Engineer #5 (employee #9).
Worked on the main open-source product (Meteor framework) as well as the early
stages of the commercial hosting software (Galaxy).

Most recently, during summer 2016, worked on developing open-source GraphQL
tools, servers, monitoring and performance products for GraphQL-based
infrastructure.

Worked on the data synchronization from databases
([LiveQuery][LiveQuery]), contributed to the front-end framework
[Blaze][Blaze]. Led the development of [integration][mobile] with
Apache Cordova, the project allowing Meteor developers to wrap their
apps into Android and iOS shells in a single command. Shipped the
[Windows port][windows].  Worked on the [project build tool][Isobuild]
performance, resulting into orders of magnitude improvements.

#### [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client)

Apollo is a caching client for any GraphQL server and UI framework. This is a JS
framework running in the browser that batches and caches requests to a GraphQL
server, knows how to normalize the returned data, and maintain a consistent data
snapshot with a partial knowledge gained from requests to the server. I worked
on it as part of my internship. I built features like: mutations with
"Optimistic UI" and cache consistency. Infinite scrolling features and wrote
numerous blog-posts explaining how it works.

Read these blog-posts to learn more: [Pagination and Infinite Scroll in Apollo](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/pagination-and-infinite-scrolling-in-apollo-client-59ff064aac61#.i3drdewvp), [Mutations and Optimistic UI](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/mutations-and-optimistic-ui-in-apollo-client-517eacee8fb0#.e4q7ngb2z), [GraphQL Concepts Visualized](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/the-concepts-of-graphql-bc68bd819be3#.ve15grfhc).

I worked on web-development frameworks. Contributed to the design of dynamic
templating language. Worked on a system analyzing MongoDB queries, allowing to
reduce the load on the database looking for real-time data notifications.
My side projects include: code assist tooling for text-editors, structured
queries parsers, toy programming languages.

            {{#subsection name="Code Analysis and Compilers" icon="code"}}
As part of the compilers class built a fully working compiler in Haskell that featured: syntax parsing and analysis, code movement optimizations, CSE/DCE/CP optimizations, register allocation and loop parallelization. The compiler was compiling code for Decaf, a toy language similar in semantics to C.

Developed a simple Lisp interpreter. Built a compiler for a toy object-oriented
programming language (Decaf, part of the Stanford class) and code assist tooling
for a JavaScript framework.
