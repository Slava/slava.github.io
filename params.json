{"name":"Slava Kim","tagline":"Self-taught software engineer","body":"![My Head](http://www.meteor.com/people/slava.jpg)\r\n\r\nBuzzword bingo is following\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Tech savvy\r\n\r\nI spend my evenings watching SICP videos, reading The Dragon Book and revisiting favourite chapters of CLRS. Two years ago I would spend my friday evening on a TopCoder round.\r\n\r\n### Startups kid\r\n\r\nMy current gig is a YC company of 13 people. The one before was 4 guys hacker house with pool!\r\n\r\n### Hipster technologies included\r\n\r\nI write my code in JavaScript, know how to use MongoDB, have no experience with SQL but if I choose one it would be Postgresql!\r\n\r\nAll my webapps are written in Meteor, I might even use CoffeeScript and will definitely choose ElasticSearch as a full-text search solution. What else can I through into those apps? Redis, RethinkDB, Doozer and PhoneGap? Sounds good.\r\n\r\nWhat is my favorite language? The answer should be \"Lisp\" but I am going with Clojure this time.\r\n\r\n### Typical Silicon Valley kid\r\n\r\nNo college, just passion and vision, you know.\r\n\r\n### Religious\r\n\r\nVim only, Emacs free. I even own books on Vim and I spent hours in the Internet arguing it is the editor *real programmers* use!\r\n\r\n### Have my setup\r\n\r\nMBP, Thunderbolt display, Kinesis Advantage keyboard and a convertible standing desk - this is the standard in my company!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Seriously\r\n\r\nI enjoy learning the advanced layers of Computer Science. After spending several years on Competitive Programming I finally arrived to the industry.\r\n\r\nRight now I am actively learning about:\r\n\r\n- SICP\r\n- Compilers (coursera course)\r\n- Distributed Systems (something I learn from my peers)\r\n\r\nToday I work at [Meteor][meteor]. Before I worked at [Collections][collections].\r\n\r\nI try to hack on different ideas on the weekends. Most of them never get implemented because of my laziness but some make it to my Github profile, mostly algorithmy things.\r\n\r\n[meteor]: https://www.meteor.com\r\n[collections]: https://collections.me","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
