Two years ago I would spend my friday evening on a TopCoder round.\r\n\r\n## Startups kid\r\n\r\nMy current gig is a YC company of 13 people. The one before was 4 guys hacker house with pool!\r\n\r\n## Hipster technologies included\r\n\r\nI write my code in JavaScript, know how to use MongoDB, have no experience with SQL but if I choose one it would be Postgresql!\r\n\r\nAll my webapps are written in Meteor, I might even use CoffeeScript and will definitely choose ElasticSearch as a full-text search solution. What else can I through in these apps? Redis, RethinkDB, Doozer and PhoneGap?
